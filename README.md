# Final Project User Manual
### Opening the File
- Launch the MARS MIPS Assembler.
- Press `Ctrl+o` or click File->Open.
- Navigate to the directory with the `mr.asm` file (it is the only file necessary to run the program).
- Click on it; you should be looking at the source code for the program.

### Building the File
- With the file open in MARS, press the F3 key to assemble the program. You should see "Assemble: operation completed successfully." at the bottom.
	- If there are issues with this step, verify with us via email to ensure that you have the latest working version of the program.
- Press the F5 key to run the program, and follow the instructions in the RUN I/O box.

### Running the File
- When the program starts, it will prompt you with an introduction message, a card, and a line to input whether or not the number you have in your head is in the card displayed. 
- The valid input choices are displayed. If you see your number press `Y/y`, but if you do not press `N/n`.
- Repeat this until you have exhausted the available cards, and you are done! The program should have successfully guessed the number you were thinking.
- After finishing the game, the program will ask if you would like to play again. You can press `Y/y` to keep playing or `N/n` to quit.

### Closing the File
- Close MARS to quit.
